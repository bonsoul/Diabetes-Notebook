# Diabetes-Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes status based on patient health data. 
Below is a brief outline of the notebook's content:

  Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Reads a diabetes dataset.
        Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handles missing values.
        Standardizes features for improved model performance.

  Model Training and Evaluation:
        Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
        Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel.
        Evaluates the model using accuracy metrics for training and test data.

  Predictive System:
        Implements a system to predict diabetes status for new inputs.
        Includes example predictions with real sample inputs.

The project demonstrates the use of Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and SVM for binary classification tasks.
